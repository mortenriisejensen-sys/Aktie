# Get Started

With our prerequisites in place, it is time to get started and create our first repository.

In a browser, navigate to https://aka.ms/algopte:

And you should see:

Click **Use This Template** and select **Create a new repository**. Select your **organizational account** as **owner** and enter **repo1** as repository name. Make the repo **public** and click **Create repository**.

After a few seconds, your new repository should be ready for you.

In your new repository, click **Settings** -> **Actions** and verify that your repository has the permissions to run actions and reusable workflows, either all workflows or GitHub and Microsoft created actions are required.

Further down on the **Settings** -> **Actions** page, you also need to ensure that GitHub Actions are allowed to create pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Actions permissions might be controlled on the organizational level as well and might not be altered in the repository.

Now, click **Actions** in the top menu, and you should see that a CI/CD workflow has already been kicked off on our empty repository.

If the CI/CD workflow hasn't completed, wait for it to complete and click the completed workflow to see details.

Note the warnings explaining that no apps have been added. The CI/CD workflow doesn't have anything to compile yet as you didn't add any source code.

Ignore the warning about available updates for now.

After this step, we are done setting up a basic AL-Go for GitHub repository and we only need to add our apps.

So, let's add an app...
