1. **Open the cloned repository** and **open the workspace** when VS Code asks you (or do it manually)

> [!NOTE]
> You can rename the `al.code-workspace` file to `<anothername>.code-workspace` to be able to better distinguish the workspaces.

10. In the **.AL-Go** folder, choose the **localDevEnv.ps1** script and Run the PowerShell script.

    ![LocalDevEnv](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b5f9304-bae0-4aba-a72d-358c266a5c94)

01. Answer the questions asked about container name, authentication mechanism, credentials and select none for license file. The script might show a dialog asking for permissions to run docker commands, select **Yes** in this dialog. Wait for completion of the script.

    ![LocalDevEnv done](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd335d7-34cb-413e-9d33-3664fee93e80)

01. In VS Code, press **Ctrl+Shift+P** and **clear the credentials cache**.

01. Open the **HelloWorld.al** file, modify the string and press **F5**. Depending on authentication selected VS Code might ask for the credentials you provided earlier.

01. Back in **VS Code**, you will see that in addition to your changes in HelloWorld.al, the launch.json was also modified with the information about the local environment. **Stage your changes**, **commit** and **sync** your changes.
