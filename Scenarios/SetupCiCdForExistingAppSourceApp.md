# Set up CI/CD for an existing AppSource App

*Prerequisites: A GitHub account and experience from the other scenarios*

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go-AppSource) and choose **Use this template**.
   ![Use this template](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/b884e577-1f72-4ad6-9cac-8ab41f364c1b)
1. Enter **app3** as repository name and select **Create Repository from template**.
1. My current AppSource App is using **Azure DevOps**, I download the **entire source** as a **.zip** file and place it on **Dropbox** or **Azure Blob storage** and create a **secure download Url** to the .zip file.
   ![Create Zip Url](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/fa287e2e-d2e9-4e62-a5e8-641a8e2d4ab3)
1. Back on github.com, under **Actions**, select the **Add existing app or test app** workflow and choose **Run workflow**. Paste in the **Secure Download URL** and choose **Run Workflow**. When the workflow finishes, complete the pull request created.
1. A CI workflow is kicked off by the pull request, this will fail with this error: *For AppSource Apps with AppSourceCop enabled, you need to specify AppSourceCopMandatoryAffixes in .AL-Go\\settings.json.*
1. Note that if you are building your AppSource app for Business Central versions prior to 22, you also need to create a secret called LicenseFileUrl, with permissions to your objects. for version 22 and later, the CRONUS license has sufficient rights to be used as a DevOps license.
1. I will use my **KeyVault from [Scenario 7](UseAzureKeyVault.md)**, by adding a secret called **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** to my GitHub repo. And then add or modify the following 3 properties in the **.AL-Go\\settings.json** file:

```json
"LicenseFileUrlSecretName": "LicenseFile",
"AppSourceCopMandatoryAffixes": [ "BingMaps" ],
```

1. Meaning that the **AppSourceCopMandatoryAffixes** is set to check that I use **BingMaps** as an affix for my objects. The second setting **is only needed** if my secret is called something else than expected. AL-Go is by default looking for a secret called **LicenseFileUrl**, but you might have multiple repositories sharing the same KeyVault but needing different secrets. In this case you create a setting called **"\<secretname>SecretName"**, specifying the actual secret name in the KeyVault. This mechanism is used for all secrets. In my **BuildVariables KeyVault**, the **LicenseFileUrl** secret is called **LicenseFile**. After these changes, my CI pipeline completes:
   ![Pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/679c0627-4e94-4e60-9248-c22ae8c77c1e)
1. AppSource apps need to be code-signed. To achieve this, you must create two secrets in the GitHub repo or in your KeyVault. **CodeSignCertificateUrl** should be a secure download URL to your `<Code Signing Certificate>.pfx` file and **CodeSignCertificatePassword** should be the password for this .pfx file. Adding these secrets will cause the **CI** workflow and the **Create Release** workflow to sign the .app files. In the pipeline, you will see a new step.
   ![Signing App](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/7e494df6-a7fb-42aa-9dc8-26c728e15270)
   If your secrets are called something else than **CodesignCertificateUrl** and **CodesignCertificatePassword**, you can add an indirection to the **.AL-Go\\settings.json** file:

```json
"CodeSignCertificateUrlSecretName": "myCodeSignCertUrl",
"CodeSignCertificatePasswordSecretName": "myCodeSignCertPassword",
```
