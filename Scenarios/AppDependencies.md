# Introducing a dependency to an app on GitHub

If your app has a dependency to another application on a different GitHub repository, the foreign repository can be added to the dependency probing paths (appDependencyProbingPaths) in the AL-Go settings file. The dependency must also be added to the `app.json` file as a dependency. During a build all the apps mentioned in the probing paths will be downloaded and installed on the tenant.

The `appDependencyProbingPaths` key in the settings expects a json array with the following structure:

```json
"appDependencyProbingPaths":  [
        {
            "repo": "https://github.com/<Owner>/<repository name>",
            "version": "<latest, specific version>",
            "release_status": "<release, prerelease, draft>",
            "authTokenSecret": "<Secret Name>",
            "projects": "*"
        }
    ]
```

**repo** specifies the URL of the foreign repository.

**version** specifies the version of the dependency to be downloaded it could be set to **latest** or a specific version.

**release_status** specifies the type of release on the foreign repository. The artifacts can be downloaded from a release, prerelease, or a draft.

**authTokenSecret** If the foreign repository is private, to download the artifacts an access token is needed. In this case a secret should be added to GitHub secrets or Azure Key vault and the name of the secret should be provided in the settings.

**projects** specifies the project in a multi project repository. “\*” means all projects.
