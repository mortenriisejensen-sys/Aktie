# Enabling telemetry

If you want to enable partner telemetry add your Application Insights connection string to the AL-Go settings file. Simply add the following setting to your settings file:

```
"PartnerTelemetryConnectionString":  "<connection string to your Application Insights>"
```

Per default, AL-Go logs some basic telemetry to Microsoft. If you want to opt-out of sending telemetry to Microsoft you can add the following setting to your settings file:

```
"microsoftTelemetryConnectionString":  ""
```

By setting the Microsoft telemetry connection string to be an empty string you opt-out of sending basic telemetry to Microsoft. If on the other hand you want to send extended telemetry to Microsoft you can do that with the following setting.

```
"SendExtendedTelemetryToMicrosoft" : true
```

Sending extended telemetry to Microsoft is helpful for when we need to help investigate an issue in your repository.

## Getting Started with Dashboard and Queries

### Getting Started with Data Explorer

AL-Go provides a template data explorer report to help you get started. To use this report:

1. Download the telemetrydashboard.json file from [here](resources/telemetrydashboard.json)
1. Open the file in an editor and replace the clusterUri and database:
   - **database**: Name of your application insights resource in Azure
   - **clusterUri**: Use the following uri but replace YourSubscriptionId, YourResourceGroup and YourApplicationInsightsName
     - https://ade.applicationinsights.io/subscriptions/YourSubscriptionId/resourcegroups/YourResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.insights/components/YourApplicationInsightsName
1. Go to https://dataexplorer.azure.com/dashboards
1. In the top left corner, click on the arrow next to "New Dashboard" and select "Import dashboard from file".

### Getting Started with writing your own queries

To get started with writing kusto queries for your AL-Go telemetry, you can use the following examples as inspiration.

The following query gets all telemetry emitted when an AL-Go workflow completes.

```
traces
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| project   timestamp,
            message,
            severityLevel,
            RepositoryOwner = tostring(customDimensions.RepositoryOwner),
            RepositoryName = tostring(customDimensions.RepositoryName),
            RunId = tostring(customDimensions.RunId),
            RunNumber = tostring(customDimensions.RunNumber),
            RunAttempt = tostring(customDimensions.RunAttempt),
            WorkflowName = tostring(customDimensions.WorkflowName),
            WorkflowConclusion = tostring(customDimensions.WorkflowConclusion),
            WorkflowDurationMinutes = round(todouble(customDimensions.WorkflowDuration) / 60, 2),
            ALGoVersion = tostring(customDimensions.ALGoVersion),
            RefName = tostring(customDimensions.RefName)
| extend HtmlUrl = strcat("https://github.com/", RepositoryName, "/actions/runs/", RunId)
| where message contains "AL-Go workflow"
```

The following query gets all telemetry emitted when an AL-Go action completes.

```
traces
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| project   timestamp,
            message,
            severityLevel,
            RepositoryOwner = tostring(customDimensions.RepositoryOwner),
            RepositoryName = tostring(customDimensions.RepositoryName),
            RunId = tostring(customDimensions.RunId),
            RunNumber = tostring(customDimensions.RunNumber),
            RunAttempt = tostring(customDimensions.RunAttempt),
            WorkflowName = tostring(customDimensions.WorkflowName),
            WorkflowConclusion = tostring(customDimensions.WorkflowConclusion),
            WorkflowDuration = todouble(customDimensions.WorkflowDuration),
            ALGoVersion = tostring(customDimensions.ALGoVersion),
            RefName = tostring(customDimensions.RefName),
            RunnerOs = tostring(customDimensions.RunnerOs),
            RunnerEnvironment = tostring(customDimensions.RunnerEnvironment),
            ErrorMessage = tostring(customDimensions.ErrorMessage),
            ActionDurationSeconds = todouble(customDimensions.ActionDuration)
| extend HtmlUrl = strcat("https://github.com/", RepositoryName, "/actions/runs/", RunId)
| where message contains "AL-Go action"
```

## Telemetry events and data

AL-Go logs four different types of telemetry events: AL-Go action ran/failed and AL-Go workflow ran/failed. Each of those telemetry events provide slightly different telemetry but common dimensions for all of them are:

**Common Dimensions**
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| PowerShellVersion | The version of powershell used to run the action |
| BcContainerHelperVersion | The version of BcContainerHelper used to run the action (if imported) |
| WorkflowName | The name of the workflow |
| RunnerOs | The operating system of the runner |
| RunId | The Run Id |
| RunNumber | The Run Number |
| RunAttempt | The attempt number |
| Repository | The repository Id |

### AL-Go action ran

Telemetry message: AL-Go action ran

SeverityLevel: 1

Additional Dimensions:
| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ActionDuration | The duration of the action |

### AL-Go action failed

Telemetry message: AL-Go action failed

SeverityLevel: 3

Additional Dimensions:

| ErrorMessage | The error message thrown |

### AL-Go workflow ran

Telemetry message: AL-Go workflow ran

SeverityLevel: 1

Additional Dimensions:

| Dimension | Description |
